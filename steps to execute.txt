# Steps to Execute the Zakhaev Mobile Clinic Website

## 3. **Test the Website**
- The website will load with all the features:
  - Dark/light theme toggle (top right corner)
  - Mobile-responsive menu (visible on small screens)
  - Consultation form (click "Start New Consultation" button)

## 4. **Interact with Features**
- **Start a Consultation**: Click the "Start New Consultation" button to show the patient form
- **Toggle Theme**: Click the moon/sun icon to switch between dark/light mode
- **Mobile Menu**: On small screens, click the hamburger menu icon to show navigation

## 5. **View Generated Reports**
- The form is set up to collect patient data (though not functional yet)
- Future development would include JavaScript to generate reports from the form data

## 6. **Deploy to Web Server (Optional)**
- For public access, upload the HTML file to a web hosting service
- Services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or traditional web hosts can be used

To make this fully functional, you would need to:
1. Add JavaScript to handle form submission
2. Implement report generation logic
3. Add database connectivity for storing patient records
4. Implement authentication for medical staff
